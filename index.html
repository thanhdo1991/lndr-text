            <p>Copyright Policy.</p>

            <p>Company respects the intellectual property of others and asks that users of our Site do the same. &nbsp;In connection with our Site, we have adopted and implemented a policy respecting copyright law that provides for the removal of any infringing materials and for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of users of our online Site who are repeat infringers of intellectual property rights, including copyrights. &nbsp;If you believe that one of our users is, through the use of our Site, unlawfully infringing the copyright(s) in a work, and wish to have the allegedly infringing material removed, the following information in the form of a written notification (pursuant to 17 U.S.C. &sect; 512(c)) must be provided to our designated Copyright Agent:</p>

            <p>your physical or electronic signature;</p>

            <p>identification of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim to have been infringed;</p>

            <p>identification of the material on our services that you claim is infringing and that you request us to remove;</p>

            <p>sufficient information to permit us to locate such material;</p>

            <p>your address, telephone number, and e-mail address;</p>

            <p>a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the objectionable material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or under the law; and</p>

            <p>a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are either the owner of the copyright that has allegedly been infringed or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Please note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. &sect; 512(f), any misrepresentation of material fact (falsities) in a written notification automatically subjects the complaining party to liability for any damages, costs and attorney&rsquo;s fees incurred by us in connection with the written notification and allegation of copyright infringement.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>General</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Changes. &nbsp;These Terms are subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us (if any), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our Site. &nbsp;You are responsible for providing us with your most current e-mail address. &nbsp;In the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice. &nbsp;Any changes to these Terms will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you (if applicable) or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our Site. &nbsp;These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Site. &nbsp;Continued use of our Site following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.</p>

            <p>Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. &nbsp;It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights. &nbsp;It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. &nbsp;This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. &nbsp;Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. &nbsp;A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 75 E Santa Clara Street, 6th Floor San Jose CA 95113, San Jose, California 95113. &nbsp;After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. &nbsp;If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. &nbsp;The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Arbitration Rules. &nbsp;Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (&ldquo;ADR Provider&rdquo;) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. &nbsp;If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. &nbsp;The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. &nbsp;The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (&ldquo;Arbitration Rules&rdquo;) governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. &nbsp;The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. &nbsp;Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. &nbsp;For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. &nbsp;Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. &nbsp;If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. &nbsp;If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. &nbsp;Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney&rsquo;s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. &nbsp;If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. &nbsp;The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Time Limits. &nbsp;If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</p>

            <p>Authority of Arbitrator. &nbsp;If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. &nbsp;The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. &nbsp;The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.</p>

            <p>Waiver of Jury Trial. &nbsp;THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. &nbsp;In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. &nbsp;ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Confidentiality. &nbsp;All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. &nbsp;The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. &nbsp;This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p>

            <p>Severability. &nbsp;If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
